# ✅ Certificate Management Integration Complete!

## What Was Done

### Code Changes (1 file modified)
**File:** `src/components/editor-panel.tsx`

1. ✅ **Added import** for `CertificateFormEditor`
2. ✅ **Added file detection** for `certificates.yaml` and `certs.yaml`
3. ✅ **Updated schema logic** to exclude certificate files
4. ✅ **Updated form mode switching** to support certificate files
5. ✅ **Updated form button** tooltip and disabled state
6. ✅ **Added rendering logic** for certificate form editor

**Total lines changed:** ~25 lines

## How It Works

### Workflow
```
1. User opens certificates.yaml file in Configuration tab
   ↓
2. File is detected as certificate file
   ↓
3. "Form" button becomes enabled
   ↓
4. User clicks "Form" to switch to form view
   ↓
5. CertificateFormEditor renders with split view:
   - Left: Form-based certificate management
   - Right: Live YAML preview
   ↓
6. User manages certificates via UI
   ↓
7. Changes are saved to Git (like secrets.yaml)
   ↓
8. ESO reads certificates.yaml and syncs from Vault
```

## File Structure

### Recommended Structure
```
your-repo/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── secrets.yaml          ← Generic secrets (existing)
│   │   └── certificates.yaml     ← NEW: Certificate references
│   ├── staging/
│   │   ├── secrets.yaml
│   │   └── certificates.yaml
│   └── prod/
│       ├── secrets.yaml
│       └── certificates.yaml
```

### certificates.yaml Format
```yaml
# ESO reference file for certificates
certificates:
  - name: CaiServerCertificate
    type: server
    vaultRef:
      path: kv-v2/dev/org1/cai/certs/servers
      key: CaiServerCertificate
    relationships:
      - type: signs
        targetPath: kv-v2/dev/org1/cai/certs/intermediates
        targetKey: intermediateCA

chains:
  ProductionServerChain:
    server:
      path: kv-v2/dev/org1/cai/certs/servers
      key: CaiServerCertificate
      type: server
    intermediate:
      - path: kv-v2/dev/org1/cai/certs/intermediates
        key: intermediateCA
        type: intermediate-ca
    rootCA:
      path: kv-v2/dev/org1/cai/certs/roots
        key: rootCA1
        type: root-ca
```

## Testing

### 1. Create Test File
I've created `test-certificates.yaml` with sample data. You can:
- Copy it to your repo as `environments/dev/certificates.yaml`
- Or create a new empty one:
  ```yaml
  certificates: []
  chains: {}
  ```

### 2. Open in UI
1. Start your application
2. Navigate to an ArgoCD Application
3. Go to "Configuration" tab
4. Browse to `certificates.yaml`
5. Click to open the file

### 3. Test Form View
1. Click the "Form" button in the toolbar
2. You should see the Certificate Management UI
3. Try these features:
   - ✅ Add certificate
   - ✅ Edit certificate
   - ✅ Delete certificate
   - ✅ Add relationships
   - ✅ Build certificate chain
   - ✅ Search/filter
   - ✅ View YAML preview (right panel)

### 4. Test Save
1. Make changes in form view
2. Click "Save" or use Ctrl+S
3. Changes should be staged for PR
4. Verify YAML is correctly generated

---

## Features Available

### Certificate Management
- ✅ Add/Edit/Delete certificates
- ✅ 4 certificate types: server, client, root-ca, intermediate-ca
- ✅ Vault path and key references
- ✅ Certificate data (thumbprint, PEM, password)
- ✅ Search and filter
- ✅ Bulk operations

### Relationships
- ✅ Define relationships between certificates
- ✅ 3 relationship types:
  - **signs**: Certificate authority hierarchy (who issued this cert)
  - **trusts**: Trust establishment (which CAs are trusted)
  - **validates**: Authentication (mTLS, client auth)
- ✅ Link certificates to CAs
- ✅ Track certificate chains
- 📖 See `docs/certificate-relationships-explained.md` for detailed explanation

### Certificate Chains
- ✅ Build complete certificate chains
- ✅ Visual chain builder
- ✅ Link server → intermediate → root CA
- ✅ Optional client certificates
- ✅ Chain preview

### Vault Integration
- ✅ Push certificates to Vault
- ✅ Store with metadata (relationships)
- ✅ Query by relationships
- ✅ Metadata persists across renewals

### UI Features
- ✅ Split view (form + YAML)
- ✅ Live YAML preview
- ✅ Diff preview before save
- ✅ Validation
- ✅ Success/error messages

## How It Integrates with ESO

### Current Flow (secrets.yaml)
```
secrets.yaml (Git)
    ↓
ESO reads file
    ↓
Fetches secrets from Vault
    ↓
Creates Kubernetes secrets
```

### New Flow (certificates.yaml)
```
certificates.yaml (Git)
    ↓
ESO reads file
    ↓
Fetches certificates from Vault
    ↓
Creates Kubernetes secrets with certificates
```

**Same pattern, different content!**

## Example ESO Configuration

### For secrets.yaml (existing)
```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: app-secrets
spec:
  secretStoreRef:
    name: vault-backend
  target:
    name: app-secrets
  data:
    - secretKey: DB_PASSWORD
      remoteRef:
        key: kv-v2/dev/my-app
        property: db-password
```

### For certificates.yaml (new)
```yaml
apiVersion: external-secrets.io/v1beta1
kind: ExternalSecret
metadata:
  name: app-certificates
spec:
  secretStoreRef:
    name: vault-backend
  target:
    name: app-certificates
  data:
    - secretKey: server-cert
      remoteRef:
        key: kv-v2/dev/org1/cai/certs/servers
        property: CaiServerCertificate
    - secretKey: root-ca
      remoteRef:
        key: kv-v2/dev/org1/cai/certs/roots
        property: rootCA1
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ Test with sample file
2. ✅ Verify form view works
3. ✅ Test save functionality
4. ✅ Verify YAML generation

### Short Term
1. Configure Vault credentials
2. Test Vault push functionality
3. Add certificate data (PEM, thumbprint)
4. Test certificate chains

### Long Term
1. Implement Vault metadata approach
2. Add certificate validation
3. Add expiration tracking
4. Add certificate renewal workflow

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Form button is disabled
**Solution:** Make sure file is named `certificates.yaml` or `certs.yaml`

### Issue: Form view doesn't render
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Verify import path is correct.

### Issue: Can't save changes
**Solution:** Verify Git credentials are configured for the repository

### Issue: YAML not generating correctly
**Solution:** Check that certificate data structure matches expected format
