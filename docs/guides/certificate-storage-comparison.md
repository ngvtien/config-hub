# Certificate Relationship Storage: Comparison

## Three Approaches

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ YAML in Git (Current Implementation)

**Storage Location:** `secrets.yaml` in Git repository

```yaml
certificates:
  - name: ServerCert
    type: server
    vaultRef:
      path: kv-v2/dev/certs/servers
      key: servercert
    relationships:
      - type: signs
        targetPath: kv-v2/dev/certs/roots
        targetKey: rootca
```

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Version Control | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Full Git history |
| Single Source of Truth | ‚≠ê | Can drift from Vault |
| Queryability | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Requires parsing YAML |
| Access Control | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Git-based permissions |
| Audit Trail | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Git commits |
| Sync Complexity | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Manual sync needed |
| Real-time Updates | ‚≠ê | Requires Git push/pull |

**Best For:** Small teams, simple setups, when Git is primary workflow

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Vault KV2 Custom Metadata (Recommended)

**Storage Location:** Vault custom metadata on each secret

```bash
# Certificate data
vault kv put kv-v2/dev/certs/servers/servercert \
  thumbprint="ABC123" \
  definition="-----BEGIN CERT-----"

# Relationships in metadata
vault kv metadata put kv-v2/dev/certs/servers/servercert \
  custom_metadata='{
    "cert_type": "server",
    "signed_by_path": "kv-v2/dev/certs/roots",
    "signed_by_key": "rootca",
    "chain_id": "production"
  }'
```

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Version Control | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Vault versions metadata |
| Single Source of Truth | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Vault is authoritative |
| Queryability | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Vault API queries |
| Access Control | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Vault policies |
| Audit Trail | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Vault audit logs |
| Sync Complexity | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | No sync needed |
| Real-time Updates | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Immediate |

**Best For:** Production environments, large teams, when Vault is primary source

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Hybrid: Vault + Git Snapshot (Best of Both)

**Storage Location:** Vault (source of truth) + Git (read-only snapshot)

```yaml
# In Git: secrets.yaml (AUTO-GENERATED - DO NOT EDIT)
_metadata:
  source: vault
  synced_at: "2025-10-15T10:30:00Z"
  warning: "This file is auto-generated from Vault"

certificates:
  - name: ServerCert
    type: server
    vaultRef:
      path: kv-v2/dev/certs/servers
      key: servercert
    # Synced from Vault metadata
    relationships:
      - type: signs
        targetPath: kv-v2/dev/certs/roots
        targetKey: rootca
    _vault_metadata:
      last_updated: "2025-10-15T09:00:00Z"
      version: 3
```

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Version Control | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Git snapshots for review |
| Single Source of Truth | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Vault is source |
| Queryability | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Both Vault API and Git |
| Access Control | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Vault policies + Git |
| Audit Trail | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Both systems |
| Sync Complexity | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Automated sync needed |
| Real-time Updates | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | Vault immediate, Git async |

**Best For:** Enterprise environments, compliance requirements, best practices

## Detailed Comparison

### Data Flow

#### Approach 1: YAML in Git
```
User edits YAML ‚Üí Git commit ‚Üí CI/CD reads YAML ‚Üí Pushes to Vault
                                                    ‚Üì
                                            Vault has cert data
                                            Git has relationships
                                            ‚ö†Ô∏è Can drift!
```

#### Approach 2: Vault Metadata
```
User edits in UI ‚Üí Vault API updates data + metadata
                   ‚Üì
                   Everything in Vault
                   ‚úÖ Single source of truth
```

#### Approach 3: Hybrid
```
User edits in UI ‚Üí Vault API updates data + metadata
                   ‚Üì
                   Vault is source of truth
                   ‚Üì
                   Automated sync ‚Üí Git snapshot (read-only)
                   ‚Üì
                   ‚úÖ Best of both worlds
```

## Use Case Recommendations

### Use YAML in Git When:
- ‚úÖ Small team (< 10 people)
- ‚úÖ Simple certificate structure
- ‚úÖ Git is primary workflow
- ‚úÖ Manual updates are acceptable
- ‚úÖ Drift detection not critical

### Use Vault Metadata When:
- ‚úÖ Production environment
- ‚úÖ Large team (> 10 people)
- ‚úÖ Complex certificate relationships
- ‚úÖ Need real-time queries
- ‚úÖ Vault is primary source
- ‚úÖ Strong access control needed

### Use Hybrid When:
- ‚úÖ Enterprise environment
- ‚úÖ Compliance requirements
- ‚úÖ Need audit trail in Git
- ‚úÖ Want PR reviews for visibility
- ‚úÖ Need both real-time and historical views
- ‚úÖ Can implement automated sync

---

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Current (YAML)
```yaml
# secrets.yaml
certificates:
  - name: ServerCert
    relationships: [...]
```

### Phase 2: Dual Write
```typescript
// Write to both Git and Vault
await saveToGit(cert)
await saveToVault(cert) // Also writes metadata
```

### Phase 3: Vault Primary
```typescript
// Read from Vault, write to Vault
const cert = await loadFromVault(path, key)
await saveToVault(cert)
```

### Phase 4: Hybrid
```typescript
// Vault is source, Git is snapshot
await saveToVault(cert)
await syncToGit() // Automated, read-only
```

---

## Code Examples

### Query: "Find all certs signed by RootCA1"

#### YAML Approach
```typescript
// Parse YAML file
const yaml = parseYaml(content)
const results = yaml.certificates.filter(cert =>
  cert.relationships?.some(rel =>
    rel.type === 'signs' &&
    rel.targetKey === 'rootca1'
  )
)
```

#### Vault Metadata Approach
```typescript
// Query Vault API
const results = await findCertificatesSignedBy(
  credentialId,
  'kv-v2/dev/certs/roots',
  'rootca1'
)
```

#### Hybrid Approach
```typescript
// Fast: Read from Git snapshot
const quickResults = parseYaml(gitSnapshot)

// Accurate: Verify with Vault
const liveResults = await findCertificatesSignedBy(...)

// Detect drift
if (quickResults.length !== liveResults.length) {
  console.warn('Drift detected! Syncing...')
  await syncToGit()
}
```

## Recommendation

**For your use case (ArgoCD + Vault + Git):**

### üèÜ Go with Hybrid Approach

**Why:**
1. ‚úÖ Vault is your source of truth (production-ready)
2. ‚úÖ Git provides PR review workflow (team collaboration)
3. ‚úÖ Automated sync keeps them in sync (no drift)
4. ‚úÖ Can query both systems (flexibility)
5. ‚úÖ Audit trail in both places (compliance)

**Implementation:**
1. Store relationships in Vault custom metadata
2. Auto-generate read-only YAML in Git
3. UI updates Vault, then syncs to Git
4. PRs show the snapshot for review
5. CI/CD reads from Vault (source of truth)

This gives you the best of both worlds! üéâ
