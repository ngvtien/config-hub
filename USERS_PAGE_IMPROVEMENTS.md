# Users Page Improvements

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Available Users Section**
- **Problem**: Showing fragmented text like "The", "command", "completed", "successfully" instead of usernames
- **Solution**: Added filtering to remove invalid entries and command output fragments
- **Improvement**: Added click-to-select functionality for available users

### **2. Groups Display**
- **Problem**: Overwhelming display of very long group names (e.g., "NT AUTHORITY\Local account and member of Administrators group")
- **Solution**: 
  - Clean up group names by removing prefixes and using readable names
  - Added show/hide toggle for groups when there are more than 3
  - Added tooltips showing full group names on hover
  - Limited display width with truncation

### **3. User Switching Confusion**
- **Problem**: Unclear what "Switch User Context" actually does
- **Solution**: 
  - Renamed to "Test User Context" for clarity
  - Added detailed explanation of what the feature does
  - Clarified it's for testing, not actual Windows session switching

### **4. Missing User Feedback**
- **Problem**: No indication when operations succeed or fail gracefully
- **Solution**: 
  - Added success messages for user context testing
  - Improved error messages with more context
  - Added loading states for all operations

## 🔧 **Technical Improvements**

### **Data Filtering:**

// Filter out command output fragments
.filter(user => user.username && user.username.trim() && 
  !['The', 'command', 'completed', 'successfully', 'successfully.'].includes(user.username.trim()))
```

### **Group Name Cleaning:**
```typescript
const cleanGroupName = group
  .replace(/^.*\\/, '') // Remove domain prefix
  .replace(/^NT AUTHORITY\\/, '') // Remove NT AUTHORITY prefix
  .replace(/^BUILTIN\\/, '') // Remove BUILTIN prefix
  .replace(/Local account and member of Administrators group/, 'Local Admin')
```

### **Enhanced State Management:**
