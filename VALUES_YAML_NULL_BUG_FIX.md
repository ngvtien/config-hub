# Values.yaml Null Content Bug - FIXED ✅

## The Bug
When attempting to edit `values.yaml` via the Form-based UI, the entire file content was being nulled out (set to empty/null).

## Root Cause
The bug occurred in the `editor-panel.tsx` component in two places:

### 1. View Mode Switching (Line ~314-327)
When switching from Form view back to YAML view:
```typescript
// OLD CODE - BUGGY
else if (newMode === 'yaml') {
  const yamlContent = yaml.dump(formData, ...)  // formData could be null!
  onContentChange(activeFile.id, yamlContent)   // This nulls out the content
}
```

**Problem**: If `formData` was `null` (which happens when there's no schema for the file), calling `yaml.dump(null)` would produce empty/null YAML content, wiping out the file.

### 2. Form Change Handler (Line ~358-372)
When form data changes:
```typescript
// OLD CODE - BUGGY
const handleFormChange = (data: any) => {
  setFormData(data.formData)
  const yamlContent = yaml.dump(data.formData, ...)  // Could dump null!
  onContentChange(activeFile.id, yamlContent)
}
```

**Problem**: Same issue - if `data.formData` is `null` or `undefined`, it would null out the file content.

## The Scenario
1. User opens `values.yaml` (which doesn't have a corresponding `.schema.json` file)
2. User clicks the "Form" button (even though it should be disabled)
3. The view mode changes but `formData` is set to `null` because there's no schema
4. When switching back to YAML view or when form changes trigger, `yaml.dump(null)` is called
5. The file content becomes null/empty

## The Fix
Added null/undefined checks before dumping YAML:

### Fix 1: View Mode Switching
```typescript
else if (newMode === 'yaml') {
  // Only update content if formData is valid (not null/undefined)
  if (formData !== null && formData !== undefined) {
    const yamlContent = yaml.dump(formData, ...)
    onContentChange(activeFile.id, yamlContent)
  }
  setViewMode('yaml')
}
```

### Fix 2: Form Change Handler
```typescript
const handleFormChange = (data: any) => {
  setFormData(data.formData)
  
  // Only update if formData is valid (not null/undefined)
  if (data.formData !== null && data.formData !== undefined) {
    const yamlContent = yaml.dump(data.formData, ...)
    onContentChange(activeFile.id, yamlContent)
  }
}
```

## Impact
- ✅ Prevents data loss when switching between view modes
- ✅ Prevents null content when form data is invalid
- ✅ File content is preserved even if form view fails to initialize
- ✅ Safe to switch view modes without losing data

## Additional Fix: Form Initialization Issue

### The Problem
Form view didn't load properly on the first click - users had to switch back to YAML then to Form again for it to work.

### Root Cause
When clicking "Form" button:
1. `handleViewModeChange` parsed YAML and set `formData`
2. But `schema` was still loading asynchronously
3. Form rendering checks `if (schema && formData)` - both must be truthy
4. Since schema was null, it showed "Form View Not Available"
5. On second click, schema had loaded, so it worked

### The Fix
Added a `useEffect` hook that initializes `formData` when:
- Schema finishes loading
- View mode is 'form'
- formData is not yet set

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  if (activeFile && schema && viewMode === 'form' && !formData) {
    try {
      const parsedData = yaml.load(activeFile.content)
      setFormData(parsedData)
    } catch (err) {
      console.error('Failed to parse YAML for form view:', err)
    }
  }
}, [schema, viewMode, activeFile, formData])
```

This ensures that when the schema loads and we're in form view, the formData is automatically initialized.

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Open `values.yaml` without a schema file
- [ ] Try clicking Form button (should be disabled)
- [ ] If form view opens, switch back to YAML view
- [ ] Verify content is NOT nulled out
- [ ] Open `values.yaml` WITH a schema file
- [ ] Click Form button - should work on FIRST click
- [ ] Verify form loads immediately with data populated
- [ ] Make changes in form view
- [ ] Switch back to YAML view
- [ ] Verify changes are preserved correctly
- [ ] Switch back to Form view
- [ ] Verify form still shows correct data
